Reusable react components

The master-branch holds a component-development-environment-template. in short: CODET (totaly made up)

- To start, execute `npm install`
- edit the name-property in `package.json` coresponding to the component-name 
- you can develop your component-classes in `./src`
- a Development-Server can be started with `npm start`
- change [component] in `"main": "./modules/[component].js"` to your component main-class, to make the module import work later on
