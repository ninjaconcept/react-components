Reusable react components

## steps
- execute `npm install`.
- you can develop component-classes in `./src`.
- append your class in `./src/main.js`.
- create a Component-Example named after your Component, e.g. `AutoCompleteInputExample.js` in `./site/examples`.
- append a route in `./site/index.js`.
- a Development-Server can be started with `npm start`.
- open `http://localhost:8080/#/auto-complete-input` to view your example.
- !!! `npm run build` will transpile your classes to es5 and saves them to `./dist`.
